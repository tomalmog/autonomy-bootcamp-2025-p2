Command Worker Test Results
===========================

Date: 2025-09-07
Status: IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED

Implementation Details:
- Command class processes TelemetryData and sends COMMAND_LONG messages
- Target tracking for altitude and yaw control
- Average velocity calculation and logging
- Two command types: MAV_CMD_CONDITION_CHANGE_ALT (113) and MAV_CMD_CONDITION_YAW (115)

Decision Logic:
1. Altitude Control:
   - Tolerance: 0.5 meters from target.z
   - Sends MAV_CMD_CONDITION_CHANGE_ALT with target altitude
   - Speed: 1 m/s ascent/descent rate
   - Returns: "CHANGE ALTITUDE: {delta_z}"

2. Yaw Control:
   - Tolerance: 5 degrees from target direction
   - Calculates angle to target using atan2(target.y-y, target.x-x)
   - Normalizes angle difference to [-180, 180] degrees
   - Sends MAV_CMD_CONDITION_YAW with relative angle
   - Speed: 5 deg/s turning rate
   - Returns: "CHANGE YAW: {angle_diff}"

Test Validation:
- Mock test shows altitude command: (1, 0, 113, 0, 1.0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 30)
- Average velocity calculation: "Average velocity: 1.00 m/s"
- Proper target tracking logic verified
- Worker receives TelemetryData from input queue, sends results to output queue
