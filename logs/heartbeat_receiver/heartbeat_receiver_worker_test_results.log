Heartbeat Receiver Worker Test Results
=======================================

Date: 2025-09-07
Status: IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED

Implementation Details:
- HeartbeatReceiver class with connection state tracking
- Receives HEARTBEAT messages with 1-second timeout
- Tracks missed heartbeats and connection state
- Disconnects after 5 missed heartbeats as required
- Worker outputs "Connected" or "Disconnected" strings to queue

State Machine Logic:
- Initial state: Disconnected
- On heartbeat received: Connected, reset missed counter
- On timeout: increment missed counter
- After 5 misses: state becomes Disconnected
- Queue output every second with current state

Integration Test Features:
- Queue-based communication with main process
- Worker controller for clean shutdown
- Read queue function to monitor worker output
- Proper multiprocessing manager setup
