Telemetry Worker Test Results
=============================

Date: 2025-09-07
Status: IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED

Implementation Details:
- Telemetry class receives LOCAL_POSITION_NED (32) and ATTITUDE (30) messages
- Combines both messages into TelemetryData object
- Uses most recent timestamp from either message
- 1-second timeout for message reception
- Returns None on timeout, logs warning

TelemetryData Structure:
- time_since_boot: Most recent timestamp (ms)
- Position: x, y, z (meters)
- Velocity: x_velocity, y_velocity, z_velocity (m/s)
- Orientation: roll, pitch, yaw (radians)
- Angular rates: roll_speed, pitch_speed, yaw_speed (rad/s)

Coordinate System:
- Assumes standard right-handed x-y-z coordinate system
- x=right, y=forward, z=up (as specified in requirements)
- Converts from NED to standard coordinates

Worker Function:
- Continuous loop with timeout handling
- Outputs TelemetryData objects to queue
- Proper error handling and logging
